* garlic
* water
* olive oil
* coffee mug

### Directions
* in a small pot pour a splash of olive oil
* smash garlic with knife so peel comes off
* once oil is hot toss in garlic
* toss in 1 bouillon cube and smash it so it is dissolved in oil
  * might make sense to turn down the heat if things start to burn
* when garlic is light brown add 1 mug of rice
* mix that shit up
* add 1.5 mugs of water and stir
* set to high until you are boiling
* turn to low and let simmer
* do not touch until you cannot hear water in the pot anymore
* once you do not hear water anymore you are done
