## Oven Roasted Chicken Thighs with stewed tomatoes

### Ingredients/tools

* 4 chicken thighs (skin + bone on is my preference)
* 1 can of stewed tomatoes (I like the mexican flavored ones)

* salt
* pepper
* booze (beer, wine, or whiskey)
* chicken broth

### Directions
* put chicken thighs in over safe baking dish (skins up)
* salt and pepper the chicken
* rough cut the onion
* toss the onion in the baking dish, doesn't matter where it lands
* put the whole can of stewed tomatoes in there, doesn't matter where they land
* splash of chicken broth (3 table spoons if you want to measure)

* oven at 375 until done, I will broil for a few minutes to crisp up the skins
